# S3-API-Python-Notebook
A Jupyter notebook containing some S3 API examples in Python3 using boto3.

The python S3 API calls and output are shown in the notebook (rendered natively by github).  I removed the InsecureWarning messages, which are output when the self-signed certificate is accepted using the ''verify=false'' flag when creating the S3 resource.

If you'd like to run the notebook yourself, download it and run it using Jupyter (http://jupyter.org/install.html)
